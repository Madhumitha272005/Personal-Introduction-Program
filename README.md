# Personal-Introduction-Program
Personal Introduction Program is a beginner-friendly Python project that collects user details such as name, age, hobby, and city using input functions. It displays a personalized welcome message using variables and f-strings, helping beginners understand interactive programs and basic Python concepts.

Step 1: Environment Setup

The project starts by installing Python 3.x, which is required to write and execute Python programs. After installation, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is set up as the development environment, and the Python extension is installed to enable Python support, syntax highlighting, and easy program execution.

🔹 Step 2: Project Initialization

A new project folder is created to organize the files professionally. Inside this folder, a Python file named personal_intro.py is created. This file contains the complete logic of the program.

🔹 Step 3: Understanding the Problem Statement

The objective of the project is to collect basic user information such as name, age, hobby, and city, and then display a friendly and personalized introduction message. This helps in learning how programs interact with users.

🔹 Step 4: Taking User Input

The program uses Python’s built-in input() function to ask questions to the user. Each answer provided by the user is stored in a separate variable. This step introduces the concept of variables and user interaction in Python.

Example:

User is asked for their name

User enters their age

User provides their hobby and city

🔹 Step 5: Processing and Formatting Output

After collecting all inputs, the program formats the output using print() statements and f-strings. F-strings allow dynamic insertion of variable values into strings, making the output more readable and professional.

🔹 Step 6: Displaying the Final Output

The program displays a welcoming message that includes all the information entered by the user. The output is designed to be friendly and engaging, helping improve the user experience.

🔹 Step 7: Testing and Debugging

The program is tested multiple times with different inputs to ensure correct functionality. Since only built-in Python functions are used, the program runs smoothly without requiring external libraries.
